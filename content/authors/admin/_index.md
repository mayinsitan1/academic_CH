I am interested in the design, fabrication and characterization of micro-nanostructures, including 0D nanoparticles, 1D nanowires, 2D fractal structures, and 3D micro/nano ordered arrays. I am engaged in the study of graphene and TMDCs semiconductors, and using these materials to construct optoelectronic devices. I use ultrafast visible/infrared microspectroscopy and Raman/Photoluminescence microspectroscopy to investigate the charge transfer dynamics in the TMDCs monolayers and observe the interlayer excitons inside heterostructures.

Using the methodological studies described above as a foundation, I envision my program expanding into photonic crystals and soluble semiconductor structures. I also want to delve into waveguides, optical microcavities, and LEDs. I also have interest in the femtosecond amplifier laser system and the corresponding physics modeling, which I have already been working on. This represents long-term research interests that will allow me and my cooperators to use the knowledge of materials and physics to make valuable contributions to the field of semiconductor devices and optical technologies.
